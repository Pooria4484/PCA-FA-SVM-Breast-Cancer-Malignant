Comparison of FA and PCA in Dimensionality Reduction for SVM in Breast Cancer Malignant or Benign Classification


This project compares Factor Analysis (FA) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction to improve the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) in classifying breast cancer as malignant or benign. The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is used to evaluate the effect of dimensionality reduction on model accuracy.


## Project Overview

- Dimensionality Reduction: The project applies PCA and FA to reduce the feature space of the dataset.
- SVM Classification: After dimensionality reduction, SVM is used to classify the data into malignant and benign classes.
- Dataset: The Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset is used, which contains various features that describe the characteristics of the tumor.
